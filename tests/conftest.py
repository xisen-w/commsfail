"""Shared fixtures.

``synthetic_trace``  a small Room, built in Python, in which every mode of the taxonomy happens once.
``sample``           every SharedNet source in tests/fixtures/ and sample/ (a record folder, a share JSON, ...), loaded.
``any_trace``        all of the above: the contract tests run every annotator on each one.
