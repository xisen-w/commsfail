"""The bundle an annotator agent reads: the timeline, each agent's actions, the task, and the codebook.

    bundle/
      timeline.md      every post and every turn boundary in time order; each agent post says what its author
                       had received when it posted (the turn's hand-off, plus the agent's own reads of the board)
      agents/<seat>.md each agent's turns and actions, with ids <seat>:<turn>:<i> (E3 only)
      task.md          the goal post
      workspace.md     the files at the end of the record, and the report (when the record has the workspace history)
      codebook.md      the classes, the patterns, severity, and the rule that classes a failure
      index.json       the same facts as data, for the checks; agents need not read it

The bundle holds no grade and no condition. The evidence level says what the input can show:
E1 posts only; E2 adds the runner's record of turns and checks; E3 adds each agent's own log.
